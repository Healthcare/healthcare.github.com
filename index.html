  <h1>Hi</h1>
  <p>I'm a designer working at <a href="http://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> currently focused on the admin product — the thing merchants use to manage their stores. I work on hard problems while teaching others how to do the same.</p>
  <p>Previously, I led teams working on making the logistics of managing orders and inventory easier for everyone. Before that I was focused on aligning the product through the creation and growth of a design system.</p>
  <p>I mostly design products but some of my more visually interesting work can be found <a href="https://dribbble.com/Healthcare">on Dribbble</a>.</p>
  <p>A Canadian national treasure.</p>
  <p>I have a Twitter account called <a href="http://www.twitter.com/heal">@heal</a> for some reason?</p>
  <p>I enjoy listening to loud, often spooky, <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/letsbefriendsokay">music</a>.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="mailto:ianmortier@gmail.com">email him</a> if you need anything.</p>
  <p>I like doing branding and logos for fun, especially if it’s game or music related. If you have a cool project you can <a href="mailto:ianmortier@gmail.com">email me about it</a>, if you need anything else good luck.
